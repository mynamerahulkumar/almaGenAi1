    "# 🦜🔗 RAG Fundamentals with LangChain & Groq\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Fundamentals**! This notebook teaches you how to build a RAG pipeline using LangChain and the **free Groq API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG combines **retrieval** (finding relevant documents) with **generation** (LLM response). Instead of relying only on the LLM's training data, we provide context from our own documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → Retrieve Relevant Docs → Augment Prompt with Context → Generate Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn:\n",
    "1. **Document Loaders** - Load PDFs and other documents\n",
    "2. **Text Splitters** - Chunk documents for processing\n",
    "3. **Embeddings** - Convert text to vectors\n",
    "4. **Vector Stores** - Store and search embeddings\n",
    "5. **Retrievers** - Find relevant documents\n",
    "6. **RAG Chains** - Build end-to-end question answering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "We'll use **Landmark Judgments of the Supreme Court of India** PDF to build a legal Q&A system.\n",

The Court held that what constitutes the \"basic structure\" would be decided on a case-to-case basis. This judgment has had a profound impact on Indian constitutional law and has been a cornerstone of the country's constitutional jurisprudence.\n"
